# Eloquence Mobile Frontend

Eloquence lets you input a sentence and then changes its words with synonyms.
This is the mobile frontend, coded with the <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic">Ionic framework</a>.
It calls a NodeJS API which parses the sentence and get synonyms from thesaurus.com.

This app was primarily meant as an exercise for me to learn how to use Ionic, Angular and NodeJS. So obviously, it's not ready for production yet and it probably never will be...
