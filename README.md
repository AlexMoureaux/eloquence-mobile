# Eloquence Mobile Frontend

Eloquence lets you input a sentence and then changes its words with synonyms.
This is the mobile frontend, coded with the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic framework</a>.
It uses a NodeJS API (see <a href="https://github.com/Almouro/eloquence-node">eloquence-node</a>) which parses the sentence and get synonyms from thesaurus.com.

This app was primarily meant as an exercise for me to learn how to use <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>. 

It's not ready for the app stores yet. Still a lot of things to do.

##Try it out
If you wish to try it out, you can clone it and follow the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/">Ionic guidelines</a>.

You can also test it in the browser: <a href="http://almouro.github.io/eloquence-mobile/www/index.html">Test in browser</a>.
