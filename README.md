# Eloquence Mobile Frontend

Eloquence lets you input a sentence and then changes its words with synonyms.
This is the mobile frontend, coded with the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic framework</a>.

It calls a NodeJS API which parses the sentence and get synonyms from thesaurus.com.

This app was primarily meant as an exercise for me to learn how to use <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>. 

It's not ready for the app stores yet. 
If you wish to try it out, you can clone it and follow the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/">Ionic guidelines</a>.
